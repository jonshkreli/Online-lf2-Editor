# Online lf2 editor

This is a project for creating a IDE for editing lf2 game. It is written in javascript and can be executed in modern browsers. So far you can open properly only .dat files of  characters. I have included frozen character project (by Prince Freeza and YinYin it's not made by me) just for example purpose.

Purpose:
Create a visual based editor, for easy navigation editing and having conceptual maps. Also data will be stored in JSON format to be edited easily further.

Features so far:
Every frame has it's own pic: show by real image. 
Shift+click in next: , hit_Ja: etc brings you directly to that frame.
